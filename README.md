### Introduction
This is a small Bullet Physics demo written in OpenGL and C++.  The aim of this demo is to generate two different types of bridges, one made with hinge constraints and the other using springs constraints. I test the constraints by dropping a number of objects onto the bridges themselves to see how they would react.
In this demonstration my main focus was to understand several different key concepts. Such as: Settings up objects by parsing data from a csv file, Bullet hinge constraints, Bullet spring constraints and finally Bullet collision callbacks.
